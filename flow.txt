Bank Application System Flow
The Java Bank Application follows a structured, user-centric flow that begins with system initialization where all account data is loaded into memory. Users are first greeted by a main menu that serves as the central navigation hub, offering four primary options: creating new accounts, accessing existing accounts, administrative functions, or exiting the system. When creating an account, users progress through a guided sequence—entering personal details, specifying an initial deposit, selecting account type (either savings with interest earnings or checking with overdraft protection), and finally receiving a system-generated account number upon successful creation. For existing account access, users must authenticate using their account number, which unlocks a comprehensive dashboard displaying current balance and available funds along with transaction options including deposits, withdrawals, transfers between accounts, and viewing transaction history. The administrative module provides higher-level functionality for viewing all accounts, applying interest to savings accounts, and accessing bank-wide statistics. Throughout the entire user journey, the system maintains robust input validation, immediate feedback for all operations, and consistent navigation patterns, ensuring a seamless banking experience whether users are performing simple deposits or complex transfers, all while maintaining data integrity through event recording and proper error handling before gracefully saving all data upon application exit.
